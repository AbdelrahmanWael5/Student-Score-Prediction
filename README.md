# Student-Score-Prediction
This is a Machine Learning project that implements the Linear Regression algorithm from scratch to use it to predict the total average score for students based on their weekly self-study hours and the career that they aspire to work in it. 
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to show how study habits and career goals impact the student performance, and to build a simple predictive model that uses this data to predict the total average score that the student will get.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scipy
- Scikit-learn (for preprocessing)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files
- `Student_Score_Prediction.ipynb` â†’ main notebook containing the analysis and the implemented model.

## Results
- Implemented a **Linear Regression** model.  
- Evaluated model performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
